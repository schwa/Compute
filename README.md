# Compute

This project provides a high-level Swift framework for working with Metal compute shaders. It simplifies the process of setting up and executing compute tasks on GPU using Apple's Metal API.

## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from Apple's SwiftUI shaders introduced in iOS 17 and macOS Sonoma. SwiftUI shaders demonstrate how GPU operations can be made more accessible to developers, enabling complex visual effects with simple Swift code. Compute aims to provide a similar level of abstraction for Metal compute shaders, making it easier to perform data-parallel computations on the GPU.

## Usage Example

Here's a quick example of how to use the Metal Compute Framework to perform a basic computation:

```swift
import Compute
import Metal

// Example usage that adds two arrays of integers using Compute.

// Metal shader source code
let source = """
#include <metal_stdlib>
using namespace metal;

kernel void add(device int* inA [[buffer(0)]],
                device int* inB [[buffer(1)]],
                device int* result [[buffer(2)]],
                uint id [[thread_position_in_grid]]) {
    result[id] = inA[id] + inB[id];
}
"""

// Set up the compute environment
let device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()!
let compute = try Computer(device: device)

// Create input data
let count = 1000
let inA = [Int32](repeating: 1, count: count)
let inB = [Int32](repeating: 2, count: count)
var result = [Int32](repeating: 0, count: count)

// Create Metal buffers
let bufferA = device.makeBuffer(bytes: inA, length: MemoryLayout<Int32>.stride * count, options: [])!
let bufferB = device.makeBuffer(bytes: inB, length: MemoryLayout<Int32>.stride * count, options: [])!
let bufferResult = device.makeBuffer(length: MemoryLayout<Int32>.stride * count, options: [])!

// Create a shader library and function
let library = ShaderLibrary.source(source)
let function = library.add

// Create a compute pipeline and bind arguments.
var pipeline = try compute.makePipeline(function: function)
pipeline.arguments.inA = .buffer(bufferA)
pipeline.arguments.inB = .buffer(bufferB)
pipeline.arguments.result = .buffer(bufferResult)

// Run the compute pipeline
try compute.run(pipeline: pipeline, width: count)

// Read back the results
var bufferPointer = bufferResult.contents()
let bufferRawBuffer32 = bufferPointer.bindMemory(to: Int32.self, capacity: bufferResult.length)
let bufferBufferPointer = UnsafeBufferPointer(start: bufferRawBuffer32, count: count)
    
// Verify the results
for i in 0..<count {
    assert(result[i] == inA[i] + inB[i], "Computation error at index \(i)")
}
```

## Requirements

Compute current requires macOS 15/iOS 17 (which as of writing are in beta). This is because Compute uses the new metal logging facilities in Metal 3.2 It is possible to use Compute with earlier versions of macOS/iOS, but you will need to modify the code to use the older Metal API. Pull requests are welcome to make this work on older OSes.

- iOS 17.0+ / macOS 15+
- Swift 6.0+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate the Metal Compute Framework into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager, add it to the dependencies value of your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/schwa/Compute.git", .from(from: "0.0.1"))
]
```

Then, specify it as a dependency of your target:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(name: "YourTarget", dependencies: ["MetalComputeFramework"]),
]
```

## Features

Compute is designed to reduce the amount of boilerplate setup code needed to use Metal compute shaders. It provides a high-level API for creating compute pipelines, binding arguments, and executing compute tasks on the GPU.

Compute brings type safety and Swift-friendly syntax to Metal compute programming. It uses Swift enums and structs to represent Metal objects and types, making it easier to work with Metal buffers, textures, and other resources.

Compute handles and throws errors upon resource creation, shader compilation, and compute pipeline execution. This makes it easier to catch and handle errors in your code.

Compute also automatically adds labels to most Metal resources to aid in debugging.
